#  Elastic characteristics
#    Comes from Lucene
#    Search Engine
#    Uses REST API, (HEAD, PUT, POST, GET, DELETE)
#    JSON format
#    Horizontal scalability
#    Run in cloud
#    Aggregation operations and geospaces searches 


# Relational Database   -->    ElasticSearch
# instance              -->    index     
# table                 -->    type
# schema                -->    mapping
# tuple                 -->    document
# column                -->    attribute    


# Shards -> Partioning the data
# Primary Shards -> The write process occurs first here (create, update and remotion)
# Secondary Chards -> The write is replicated at secondary chards
# Lots of chards will gain in write process, on the other hand it can slow down the read process. 
# It is not good to have more than 50 GB per shard 
# The number of shards is defined when the index is created, and it can't be changed after that.
# The number of replicas is defined at the index creation, but it can be changed after. 

# With GET, HEAD and put it is oligated to use and id
# If you don't provide what is the version you want, el will return the last version
# If you don't provide the id in POST request, the id will be auto-incremented
# If you provide the document id, it will create or update partially the document
#   Ex: POST /<index>/<type>/<id>/_update
# The PUT command will overwrithe the whole document

# Checking health of kibana
GET /<index>/health?v

# Checking indices
GET /<index>/indices?v

# Set number of replicas of an indice
PUT /<index>/_settings
{
  "index":{
    "number_of_replicas" : 0
  }
}

#Get the number of documents
GET /<index>/<type>/_count

#Get the Element with this unique identifier 
GET /<index>/<type>/<identifier>

#Get all documents
GET /<index>/<type>/_search

#Simple search
GET /<index>/<type>/_search?q=<term>

#Simple search imposing a limit to number of elements
GET /<index>/<type>/_search?q=<term>&size=<numberofelements>

#Simple search imposing a limit to number of elements, using pagination.
GET /<index>/<type>/_search?q=<term>&size=<numberofelements>&from=<position>

# GET with all attribute
GET /<index>/<type>/_search?q=_all:<something>

# Simple get wchich return juts the attributes you want
GET /<index>/<type>/<id>?pretty&_source=<attribute>


# Meaning of result body
# took --> Time to execute the search i miliseconds
# time_out --> If the search reach the time limit
# _shards.total --> Number of shards that the search lookd format
# _shards.successful -> Number of shards which successully complete the search
# _shards.failed --> Number of shards which failed during the search process
# hits.total --> Number of documents found.
# hits.max_score -->  Value between 0 and 1, represents how much the match with the document with term searched. 1 is perfect match 
# hits.hits --> All the documents found.






########### Analysers generate the tokens
# White Space -> Elminate blank space 
# Simple -> Only letters, to lowercase
# Standard -> No sapce, no points accents
# Idiom -> it is specific for each language


# Verify if the document exists
HEAD /<index>/<type>/<id>

# Delete a document 
DELETE /<index>/<type>/<id>

# Update a document
POST /<index>/<type>/<id>/_update


# Set number of replicas to zero  when workin with single node
